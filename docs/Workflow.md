# Initiate measurements
This will automatically calculate all of your fluxes. If you selected Best
pearson's R in as the flux finding mode in the project initiation and you have a
lot of long measurements with a short minimum calculation data length, this can
take quite long as the program goes through each measurement second by second.
## Recalculate
Hitting recalculate will recalculate all of your fluxes that have new height/volume data. Meaning that you can process all of your fluxes without having any height/volume data, and then add that data later.
# Load measurements
This just loads measurements into memory for processing. My PC can handle 5000~
15 minute measurements pretty well. If the program feels laggy, load less data
from here.
# Validate measurements
