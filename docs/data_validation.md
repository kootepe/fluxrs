# Data validation
This is the tab that all of the work will be done in. You can adjust the start,
close, open and end times of a cycle, mark cycles as invalid, mark individual
gas measurements as invalid, adjust the area where the flux calculation will be
done, view all of the fluxes of your loaded measurements and lots more.

## The default view

By default these plots are shown, the plot of the main gas measurement, the best
flux plot, and the lag plot.
